# 🔥This is a RESTful API that would power a personal blog.

## 📝Task Contents 

### *This implies that you'd have to create a backend API with the following responsibilities:*
- [**Return a list of articles. You can add filters such as publishing date, or tags.**]()
- [**Return a single article, specified by the ID of the article.**]()
- [**Create a new article to be published.**]()
- [**Delete a single article, specified by the ID.**]()
- [**Update a single article, again, you’d specify the article using its ID.**]()
- [**And with those endpoints you’ve covered the basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete/Destroy).**]()
